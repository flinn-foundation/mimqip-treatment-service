3,1,M420a,Your patient has been prescribed  [medication]  which requires periodic blood level determinations to verify that the medication is in the effective dose range for treatment.  The most recent blood level determination for  [medication]  was on [blood_level_date].

4,1,M420b,"Your patient has been prescribed  [medication]  which requires periodic blood level determinations to verify that the medication is in the effective dose range for treatment.  Your patient does not have a blood level determination for  [medication]  in MQIP so the analysis of your patient's adequate medication trial with   [medication]  will be based on the prescribed dose of the medication.  This is a considerably less reliable way of determining whether the patient is receiving an adequate dose of the medication.  If you have a recent [medication]  blood level for you patient please enter it into MQIP.  If not, consider ordering a blood level determination for the medication."
5,1,M101,Your patient's medications are fully consistent with the guidelines for the patient's current diagnosis and stage of treatment.
6,1,M102,Your patient's medications are not consistent with the guidelines for the patient's current diagnosis and stage of treatment because the medications that have been prescribed are inconsistent with the guideline recommendations or no medications have yet been prescribed.

76,1,M110,"Your patient has a prior history of BPD(D) and was presumably prescribed lamotrigine in response to that episode.  The lamotrigine was continued when your patient's diagnosis was changed to the current diagnosis of BPD(M).  Lamotrigine is not a medication that is consistent with any of the guideline stages in the treatment of BPD(M) because it has limited demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of a manic episode.  There is evidence, however, that lamotrigine may be effective as a prophylactic treatment for recurrent BPD(D).  Therefore, some clinicians might consider it an adjunctive medication in the treatment of BPD(M) for patients who have had a previous episode of BPD(D).  If you choose to prescribe lamotrigine for this reason you might find the discussion on lamotrigine in the VA guidelines on the Management of Bipolar Disorder in Adults helpful. <br/><br/><a href=""http://www.healthquality.va.gov/Management_of_Bi.asp"" target=""_blank"">http://www.healthquality.va.gov/Management_of_Bi.asp</a>"

11,1,M301,"In clinical situations which require treatment with an antipsychotic medication the prescription of 2 antipsychotic medications in the same class, such as 2 second generation antipsychotics, is generally contraindicated because there is no evidence that more than one antipsychotic of the same class provides any additional clinical benefit.  An exception to this general guideline occurs when a medication of one class is being switched for a different medication of the same class.  In such cases the original medication is often tapered as the dose of the new medication is increased.  MQIP will see this as inconsistent with the guidelines until the original medication is finally discontinued."
12,1,M302,"In clinical situations which require treatment with an antidepressant medication the prescription of 2 antidepressant medications in the same class, such as 2 SSRIs, is generally contraindicated because there is no evidence that more than one antidepressant of the same class provides any additional clinical benefit.

13,1,M303,The prescription of an MAOI with an SSRI or a SNRI is always contraindicated because it may produce a lethal adverse reaction.

Next, check whether the patient has had adequate medication trials on the prescribed antidepressant medications  and/or antipsychotic medications.  If not, consider increasing the dose of these medications, as tolerated, unless there are medical reasons for not doing so.  Try to change one medication at a time so if the patient has a positive responds it will be clear what medication caused the response.  If the patient is already at the maximum dose for these medications, consider switching to another antidepressant medication or antipsychotic medication in the same treatment stage.  Alternatively, consider moving the patient to the next stage of treatment."
16,1,M521,"Your patient is currently symptomatic and experiencing clinically significant side effects.

21,1,M530,"There appears to be general agreement in the clinical literature on how to manage side effects that emerge during psychopharmacological treatment.  The first step is to try lowering the medication causing the side effects.  The goal is to diminish or eradicate the side effects without affecting the therapeutic benefits of the medication.  If this approach is not successful an attempt can be made to address the side effects to make them tolerable.  This approach depends on the nature of the side effects.  If, for example, an SSRI is producing nausea, the dosing schedule for the medication can be changed so the patient takes the medication at meal time.  Similarly, if a patient experiences activation or insomnia when taking an antidepressant the medication can be administered in the morning when it will not interfere with sleep.  Some side effects, such as transitory anxiety associated with the initial stages of treatment with some antidepressant medications can be ameliorated with short term anxiolytic medications.  In some cases, simply slowing the rate of increase in the dose of the medication will allow the patient to accommodate to the side effects.  If the side effects cannot be effectively addressed the next option might be to change the medication.  If a patient has had a good clinical response to a medication, but is having problems with side effects, it might be useful to switch to another medication with the same mode of action but a different side effect profile.  If these approaches are not successful the patient may have to be switched to a medication with a completely different mode of action than the previous medications.

22,1,M607a,Your patient's current [drs_name]  score and/or global rating scales scores were entered less than 3 days ago.  These scores will be used for the analysis of your patient's current clinical status unless you enter more current values for these scales.

The analysis of the patient's clinical status and the treatment suggestions made by MQIP depend on current information in these scales.  If the information is not current the analysis and suggestions should not be considered relevant.

78,1,M593,"There are 4 major side effects associated with FGA and SGA medications: 1) extrapyramidal symptoms including tardive dyskinesia (TD),  2) weight gain and metabolic syndrome,  3) prolactin elevation and its associated sexual side effects, and 4) QTc prolongation.  The risk of these side effects varies among the different antipsychotic medications.  A more detailed discussion of the treatment of side effects in patients suffering from schizophrenia, who are treated with antipsychotic medications,  can be found in the following resource (Buchanan 2010). <br/>( <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2800144/pdf/sbp116.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2800144/pdf/sbp116.pdf</a> )<br/><br/>There appears to be general agreement in the clinical literature on how to manage side effects that emerge during psychopharmacological treatment.  The first step is to try lowering the medication causing the side effects.  The goal is to diminish or eradicate the side effects without affecting the therapeutic benefits of the medication.  If this approach is not successful an attempt can be made to address the side effects to make them tolerable.  This approach depends on the nature of the side effects.  If, for example, an SSRI is producing nausea, the dosing schedule for the medication can be changed so the patient takes the medication at meal time.  Similarly, if a patient gains excessive weight while taking antipsychotic medication, enrollment in a psychosocial weight reduction program or prescription of weight reduction medication may be helpful.  If the side effects cannot be effectively addressed the next option might be to change the medication.  If a patient has had a good clinical response to a medication, but is having problems with side effects, it might be useful to switch to another medication with the same mode of action but a different side effect profile.  For example, among the SGAs, olanzapine is known to have the highest incidence of weight gain.  Switching to aripiprazole or ziprasidone may help ameliorate the problems with weight gain.<br/><br/>Buchanan RW, Kreyenbuhl J, Kelly DL, et al.
