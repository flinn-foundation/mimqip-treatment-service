3,1,M420a,Your patient has been prescribed  [medication]  which requires periodic blood level determinations to verify that the medication is in the effective dose range for treatment.  The most recent blood level determination for  [medication]  was on [blood_level_date].  This value will be used in subsequent analyses unless you enter a more recent blood level for  [medication]  into MiMQIP.
77,1,M111,"Lamotrigine is not a medication that is consistent with any of the guideline stages in the treatment of BPD(M) because it has limited demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of a manic episode.  There is evidence, however, that lamotrigine may be effective as a prophylactic treatment for recurrent BPD(D).  Therefore, some clinicians might consider it an adjunctive medication in the treatment of BPD(M) in patients who have had a previous episode of BPD(D).  There is no evidence in the MQIP database that your patient has had a prior BPD(D) episode.  If your patient has had such an episode and you choose to prescribe prophylactic lamotrigine you might find the discussion on lamotrigine in the VA guidelines on the Management of Bipolar Disorder in Adults helpful. <br/><br/><a href=""http://www.healthquality.va.gov/Management_of_Bi.asp"" target=""_blank"">http://www.healthquality.va.gov/Management_of_Bi.asp</a>"
11,1,M301,"In clinical situations which require treatment with an antipsychotic medication the prescription of 2 antipsychotic medications in the same class, such as 2 second generation antipsychotics, is generally contraindicated because there is no evidence that more than one antipsychotic of the same class provides any additional clinical benefit.  An exception to this general guideline occurs when a medication of one class is being switched for a different medication of the same class.  In such cases the original medication is often tapered as the dose of the new medication is increased.  MQIP will see this as inconsistent with the guidelines until the original medication is finally discontinued."
12,1,M302,"In clinical situations which require treatment with an antidepressant medication the prescription of 2 antidepressant medications in the same class, such as 2 SSRIs, is generally contraindicated because there is no evidence that more than one antidepressant of the same class provides any additional clinical benefit.

13,1,M303,The prescription of an MAOI with an SSRI or a SNRI is always contraindicated because it may produce a lethal adverse reaction.
14,1,M304,The prescription of an SSRI with a SNRI is contraindicated because there is no evidence that the combination produces any clinical advantage over either drug alone.
15,1,M520,"Your patient is currently symptomatic (PHQ9 score of  > 15).  [Gender_pronoun] is not currently experiencing any clinically significant side effects.   There are several possibilities you might want to consider for further treatment.  First verify that the patient is still compliant with the medication(s) you prescribed.  Next, check whether the patient has had adequate medication trials on the prescribed antidepressant medications  and/or antipsychotic medications.  If not, consider increasing the dose of these medications, as tolerated, unless there are medical reasons for not doing so.  Try to change one medication at a time so if the patient has a positive responds it will be clear what medication caused the response.  If the patient is already at the maximum dose for these medications, consider switching to another antidepressant medication or antipsychotic medication in the same treatment stage.  Alternatively, consider moving the patient to the next stage of treatment."
24,1,M422a,"The patient's Brief Bipolar Disorder Symptom Scale (BDSS) score has decreased by [bdss_score_difference] points, which represents a decrease of [bdss_score_difference_percent]% since the patient's previous clinical evaluation.  The total BDSS score provides a measure of the intensity or acuity of all the patient's symptoms rather than focusing specifically on mania, depression, or psychosis.  In this case the overall severity of the patient's symptoms has decreased since the last appointment."

78,1,M593,"There are 4 major side effects associated with FGA and SGA medications: 1) extrapyramidal symptoms including tardive dyskinesia (TD),  2) weight gain and metabolic syndrome,  3) prolactin elevation and its associated sexual side effects, and 4) QTc prolongation.  The risk of these side effects varies among the different antipsychotic medications.  A more detailed discussion of the treatment of side effects in patients suffering from schizophrenia, who are treated with antipsychotic medications,  can be found in the following resource (Buchanan 2010). <br/>( <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2800144/pdf/sbp116.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2800144/pdf/sbp116.pdf</a> )<br/><br/>There appears to be general agreement in the clinical literature on how to manage side effects that emerge during psychopharmacological treatment.  The first step is to try lowering the medication causing the side effects.  The goal is to diminish or eradicate the side effects without affecting the therapeutic benefits of the medication.  If this approach is not successful an attempt can be made to address the side effects to make them tolerable.  This approach depends on the nature of the side effects.  If, for example, an SSRI is producing nausea, the dosing schedule for the medication can be changed so the patient takes the medication at meal time.  Similarly, if a patient gains excessive weight while taking antipsychotic medication, enrollment in a psychosocial weight reduction program or prescription of weight reduction medication may be helpful.  If the side effects cannot be effectively addressed the next option might be to change the medication.  If a patient has had a good clinical response to a medication, but is having problems with side effects, it might be useful to switch to another medication with the same mode of action but a different side effect profile.  For example, among the SGAs, olanzapine is known to have the highest incidence of weight gain.  Switching to aripiprazole or ziprasidone may help ameliorate the problems with weight gain.<br/><br/>Buchanan RW, Kreyenbuhl J, Kelly DL, et al.

70,1,M601,"Adjust the dose of lithium until the patient is in the therapeutic blood level range for the medication.  The recommended blood level for lithium, when it is used as a augmenting agent for the treatment of depression, is generally lower than the blood level recommended for treatment of bipolar mania.  ""Response often occurs at low dosages (600-1,200 mg/day) and at relatively low serum levels. Current data suggest that serum levels in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 mEq/L are effective in lithium augmentation of antidepressant effects.""<br/><br/>Manual of Clinical Psychopharmacology.

75,1,M606,Please note that in the current guideline for treatment of bipolar disorder (depressed) a traditional antidepressant medication is not recommended without concurrent prescription of a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic medication to lessen the likelihood of the antidepressant medication provoking a manic episode.
